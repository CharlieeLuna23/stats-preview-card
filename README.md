## My process

### Built with

### What I learned

I This time I did learn how to add a tint to an image, something I hadn't done before honestly but it helped me had a challenge this time.

### Continued development

I had a hard time styling the stats div because I wasn't able to find a way to correctly do it using only flexbox. Fortunately I later realized a way to do this but I'm not sure if it's a correct solution just adding margin-right.

### Useful resources
